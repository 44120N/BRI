# Introduction
* ## Why does it matter?
	* It's healthy.
	  This isn't about attracting others. It's about expressing yourself & presenting an accurate representation of who you think you are. Having the world see you as you want to be seen is simply good for mental health. It makes you feel good.
	* Presenting yourself with *elegance* is key for a good first impression. One of the pillars that supports networking.

# **5 PRINCIPLES OF DRESSING UP**

* ### Color is like hotsauce
	* ***The color wheel**: colors on the opposite of each others are complimentary. Theoretically these colors complement each other, however it's risky. You can end up looking bad.
	* **Analogous colors**: next to each other(skip 1 color) on the color wheel. Pairing together these colors creates a harmonious & less shocking look.
	* **Monochromatic**: Pick one color and pair varying shades with each other so that it creates a monochromatic single colored look. (Apparently this is what I used for my github profile & brutalist websites).

	* One surefire way to create a cohesive balanced outfit is: build a base using neutral colors and add one statement piece.
	* Use the sandwich method of dressing: It looks good. White black white black.
* ### Shape over everything
	* Definition:
	  Silhouette = Basic shape that your entire body makes.
	  Proportion = Balance between different elements in your outfit. (end of shirt, above or below waistline).
	* Equation:
	  Silhouette + Proportion = Shape
	* **Shape of your clothes** is potentially the most important part of how your clothes will look on you.
	  Use size & shape of your clothes to ==highlight the good attributes & draw less attention away from the less flattering one==.
	* If you have big body but skinny legs then use baggy pants.
	* Pants:
	  Get yourself something in between slim fit & baggy pants. Don't follow the trend & stay in the middle. You'll look bad 60 years later in the photo. Something in between slim & baggy is *timeless*.
* ### Shoes are 50% of your outfit
	*"Hair and shoe say it all. Everything in between is forgivable as long as you keep it simple."* -Rick Owens
	* Get yourself a nice pair of ==white canvas==
	* Cool, effortless, old money aesthetics, unifier of men and women.
	  It's *timeless*
	* Sometimes: Wear shoes that aren't sneakers.
	  DO NOT WEAR SNEAKER WITH A SUIT. It won't work 99% of the time.
* ### Personal style takes a while
  Sometimes "personal style" does not even exist.
	* It's like making a bunch of stuff & let the definition presents itself.
	  **If you define something too early you limit what it could be.**
	* Focus on dressing well, not dressing uniquely.
	  *Dress with intention, not attention.*
* ### Health is the best accessory
	* **Health defines who you are.**
	* Your dress will look better when you're healthy. Physically, mentally, emotionally, well hydrated, well adjusted, well rested, even well moisturized. 
	* Dressing well is intriguing because it suggest a more interesting lifestyle beyond the clothes.
